# Changelog

Newest first. Results, failed approaches and the handoff state; not a diary.

## 2026-10-07: M0 bootstrap batch landed; first real-data run (M1 slice)
- Nine parallel units became PRs #1–#9: archive, catalog, rank, cutouts, crossmatch, runner/CLI, OSS,
  agent harness, landscape. The integration branch merges all of them and adds a contact sheet to the
  runner. 297 offline tests pass.
- First end-to-end run on real public data: run `20261007T020124Z-4bfabaaa`, config `reference_sample_v1`,
  about 3 minutes on the owner's laptop.
  - Merged sources: SMACS 0723 NIRCam (6 bands) 5,254; MIRI (4 bands) 530; CEERS t021 (7 bands) 7,582.
  - The top 20 per sample get cutouts through S3 byte-range reads (no full i2d download) and a
    SIMBAD/NED/Gaia cross-check.
- Results. These come from the integrating agent's visual classification of the contact sheets
  plus the cross-match; nothing is vetted.
  - SMACS NIRCam top 20: mostly bright stars with diffraction spikes (7 confirmed by Gaia/SIMBAD,
    about 11 PSF-like), 2 image artifacts (a streak and low-weight noise), and galaxies or blends.
    Ranks 6 and 19 are elongated and arc-like; they are hypotheses to vet against published lens models.
  - MIRI top 20: 10/20 carry image-quality flags (edge or low weight). One known lens-related object
    (NED `G_Lens`) was recovered; it is a known object, not a discovery.
  - CEERS control: with F200W only, about 16/20 were artifacts (edges, hot-pixel-like compact sources,
    linear streaks). With all 7 bands, about 5/20 are artifacts and the rest are structured galaxies, so
    cross-band features matter.
  - Interpretation: the baseline mostly surfaces stars and instrument or processing artifacts, as
    expected. Quality gating and star/galaxy separation come next (TASKS Now 1–2).
- Injection-recovery (unit 3, NIRCam): only LOF clearly beats random on every injection type. The
  combined score reaches precision@50 of 0.06–0.20. Nothing is tuned toward one injection type until
  vetted labels exist (D-004).
- Data caveats: program 2736 catalogs were made with jwst 2.0.1 and CEERS with jwst 3.0.0, and deblending
  changed in between (D-010). The CEERS `s_ra/s_dec` is the MIRI target; use `s_region` instead.
- Process lessons:
  - `setup-uv` has no floating major tag, so pin the full version.
  - Workers collided in the shared scratchpad; each now gets its own subdirectory (CLAUDE.md).
  - Unit 5's `gh pr create` was blocked, so the coordinator opened #9 with an inline body;
    `--body-file` is denied by project settings.
- Guardrails:
  - `main` is protected: a PR and 4 CI checks are required, admins included.
  - A ruleset blocks force-push on every branch.
  - Private vulnerability reporting and Dependabot security updates are on.
  - Direct commits to `main` happened only in Step 0, before protection existed.
- **Handoff:** the owner merges #1–#9 in any order, then this integration PR (updated by merging `main`
  into it). The next cycle starts at TASKS "Now" item 1.

## 2026-10-07: M0 bootstrap started
- Created repository skeleton: interfaces (`schema.py`, stage stubs with fixed signatures), state files,
  CI, BSD-3-Clause license, verbatim agent charter (`docs/agent-charter.md`) imported by `CLAUDE.md`.
- Verified on MAST: program 2736 level-3 NIRCam/MIRI imaging is public; catalogs ~3 MB vs NIRCam i2d
  ~1.8 GB, hence the catalog-first slice (D-001). The S3 mirror key pattern is confirmed.
- Owner decisions: public repo; every change via PR and the owner merges; chat in Chinese.
