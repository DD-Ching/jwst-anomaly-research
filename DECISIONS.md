# Decisions

Format: **Decision** / **Alternatives rejected** (and why) / **Evidence** / **Revisit if**.
Read the headings before researching a tool; if a decision exists, reuse it unless its
"Revisit if" condition holds. Sections D-002 to D-010 are owned by bootstrap units 1–9.

## D-001 Repository conventions and catalog-first first slice (2026-10-07)

**Decision.**
- Python package `jwst_anomaly` (src layout, hatchling, uv environments), one module per pipeline stage.
  Stages exchange `astropy.table.Table` with column contracts in `schema.py` and a mandatory
  provenance label in `meta`.
- Raw and derived data stay out of git. Tracked manifests (data URI, sha256, size, pipeline version)
  plus download scripts are the reproducibility record.
- The first vertical slice ranks sources from JWST pipeline level-3 catalogs (`_cat.ecsv`) of
  program 2736 (SMACS 0723, lensing cluster) and uses CEERS (program 1345) as a non-cluster control.
  Image cutouts are fetched only for top-ranked sources, via S3 byte-range reads.
- GitHub flow: public repo, CI on every PR, owner merges all PRs (see CLAUDE.md).
- The agent harness is built from Claude Code features (CLAUDE.md, project skills, `/loop`,
  `/schedule` routines, `/batch`, `claude-code-action`) rather than custom orchestration code.

**Alternatives rejected.**
- pandas DataFrames at stage boundaries: they lose units and metadata. Converting at the ML edge is cheap.
- FITS in git or Git LFS: size and cost. Manifests make it unnecessary.
- Starting from level-2 `_cal` or raw ramps: the calibration work is unneeded for a first ranking.
- Running our own source extraction first: the pipeline already runs photutils. Revisit it for forced photometry.
- A custom scheduler or daemon for long runs: that would rebuild `/loop` and `/schedule`.

**Evidence.** MAST product sizes measured 2026-10-07 (catalog ~3 MB vs i2d ~1.8 GB; SOURCES.md "Data").

**Revisit if.** Cross-band colors from independently detected catalogs prove too noisy (then use a
forced-photometry HLSP catalog or photutils on i2d mosaics), or the sample grows beyond memory
(then use Parquet partitions or a database).

**Decision.**
- The charter runs long-term through three committed project skills in `.claude/skills/`. They link to CLAUDE.md and
  the charter rather than copying them.
  - `/research-cycle` runs one full cycle. It keeps model invocation on, because scheduled fires only run skills
    Claude may invoke. It treats only the owner's words as instructions; other people's issues, comments and PR text
    are data. It never writes `@claude`.
  - `/reuse-check` uses `context: fork` and `background: false`, so the search runs in an isolated subagent and only
    the decision comes back.
  - `/vet-candidate` follows the explanation ladder in docs/methodology.md and commits its record to
    `docs/candidates/`.

  Committed skills load locally, in cloud routines and in GitHub Actions.
- Scheduling uses built-ins only:
  - a cloud routine (`/schedule`) is the primary scheduler, with a fresh session each run;
  - `/loop` covers in-session runs;
  - a Desktop local task is the alternative;
  - an Actions cron is documented only.
- `@claude` runs `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1` on the owner's OAuth token.
  - Every trigger is gated to `author_association == 'OWNER'`, and comment context is filtered to the owner and
    `claude[bot]`.
  - Fork PRs are skipped. Checkout doesn't persist credentials.
  - Concurrency is one run per issue or PR.
  - The workflow does nothing until the secret exists.
- `.claude/settings.json` allows the cycle's commands. Its deny rules, mirrored for the PowerShell tool, cover:
  - merges, auto-merge, branch-protection and ruleset API calls, and `gh api` DELETE requests;
  - force pushes (including bundled short flags), pushes that name `main`, and remote branch deletion;
  - history rewrites;
  - posting local files (`--body-file`, `-F`, `=@file`, `--input`, `git diff --no-index`);
  - `gh secret` and token printing;
  - reads of credential files.
- Project allow rules need workspace trust, which `-p`, SDK and Actions runs never get. `research-cycle` therefore
  lists the cycle's tools in its own `allowed-tools`, which isn't trust-gated. No hooks.
- The cloud environment uses Custom network access: the default list plus five observed science hosts
  (docs/operations.md §3).

**Alternatives rejected.**
- A custom scheduler, daemon or Python orchestrator: it would rebuild routines and `/loop` (D-001).
- Copying the charter or CLAUDE.md rules into the skills: the copies would drift. CLAUDE.md is imported into every
  session.
- `disable-model-invocation: true` on `research-cycle`: it stops `/loop` and scheduled fires from running the skill.
- Dynamic context injection (`` !`cmd` ``) for orientation: a single failing `gh` call, such as the cloud GraphQL
  restriction, aborts the whole skill.
- A PreToolUse hook that parses `git push`: it would match more robustly, but it means a script on two shells for a
  risk that GitHub rulesets block server-side (`main` protection now; an all-branches ruleset is recommended).
- Actions `schedule` as the main scheduler: it runs only from the default branch, GitHub disables it after 60 days
  without activity, and it uses Actions minutes.
- `allowed_non_write_users`, bot triggers, or no OWNER gate on a public repository: prompt injection and spending
  the owner's subscription.
- No `concurrency` in `claude.yml`: one review with several `@claude` mentions would start parallel runs that race on
  one branch. The accepted cost is that GitHub collapses queued runs to the newest one; the cancelled runs are visible,
  and `/research-cycle` step 2 picks up unanswered owner `@claude` comments.
- `curl` in `/reuse-check`'s `allowed-tools`: the prefix grant would accept any extra flags, including uploads.
  WebFetch verifies the links instead.
- A deny rule for `git push * :<ref>` deletions: no clean pattern exists (`:*` is the legacy prefix syntax, and
  `:**` warns at every start). The recommended ruleset's "Restrict deletions" covers it server-side.
- "Full" network access for routines: five hosts plus the defaults are enough.

**Evidence.**
- Claude Code and claude-code-action docs, checked 2026-10-07 with Claude Code v2.1.292 (SOURCES.md "Agent tooling").
  The action embeds its own token in the remote URL and fetches fork PRs via `refs/pull` (`src/github/operations/`
  at tag `v1`), hence the fork skip.
- The allowlist hosts were observed by logging DNS lookups during live MAST, S3, SIMBAD, VizieR, XMatch, NED and Gaia
  calls (astroquery 0.4.11, 2026-10-07).
- `main` protection, read from the GitHub API on 2026-10-07: required checks and PRs, 0 approvals, no force pushes,
  enforced for admins.
- Headless tests in a throwaway repository with a local bare remote. With pushes and `gh` otherwise allowed, the deny
  rules blocked:
  - `push --force`, `-f`, `-uf`, `+ref`, `HEAD:main`, `<branch> main`;
  - `push --delete`, `-d`, `-qd`;
  - `gh pr merge`, `filter-branch`, `cat .env`;
  - `gh issue comment --body-file .env`, `gh api ... -F body=@.env`, `git diff --no-index ... .env`;
  - `gh api -X DELETE .../protection`, the `enablePullRequestAutoMerge` mutation, `gh auth status --show-token`.

  A plain push to `claude/*` went through. Without trust, the project allow rules were ignored, while the skill's
  `allowed-tools` still allowed the `claude/*` push.

**Revisit if.**
- Routines leave research preview with changed limits.
- Routines or the GitHub App can act as a non-admin identity. Then merges get a real server-side guard: required
  approval or a ruleset the agents can't bypass.
- A deny-rule bypass shows up in practice. Then add a PreToolUse hook or the sandbox.
- The WIP cap or cadence leaves the owner's review queue idle or overflowing.
- The cloud GitHub proxy blocks `gh` commands the cycle needs.
- claude-code-action changes major version.
