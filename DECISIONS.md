# Decisions

Format: **Decision** / **Alternatives rejected** (and why) / **Evidence** / **Revisit if**.
Read the headings before researching a tool; if a decision exists, reuse it unless its
"Revisit if" condition holds. Sections D-002 to D-010 are owned by bootstrap units 1–9.

## D-001 Repository conventions and catalog-first first slice (2026-10-07)

**Decision.**
- Python package `jwst_anomaly` (src layout, hatchling, uv environments), one module per pipeline stage.
  Stages exchange `astropy.table.Table` with column contracts in `schema.py` and a mandatory
  provenance label in `meta`.
- Raw and derived data stay out of git. Tracked manifests (data URI, sha256, size, pipeline version)
  plus download scripts are the reproducibility record.
- The first vertical slice ranks sources from JWST pipeline level-3 catalogs (`_cat.ecsv`) of
  program 2736 (SMACS 0723, lensing cluster) and uses CEERS (program 1345) as a non-cluster control.
  Image cutouts are fetched only for top-ranked sources, via S3 byte-range reads.
- GitHub flow: public repo, CI on every PR, owner merges all PRs (see CLAUDE.md).
- The agent harness is built from Claude Code features (CLAUDE.md, project skills, `/loop`,
  `/schedule` routines, `/batch`, `claude-code-action`) rather than custom orchestration code.

**Alternatives rejected.**
- pandas DataFrames at stage boundaries: they lose units and metadata. Converting at the ML edge is cheap.
- FITS in git or Git LFS: size and cost. Manifests make it unnecessary.
- Starting from level-2 `_cal` or raw ramps: the calibration work is unneeded for a first ranking.
- Running our own source extraction first: the pipeline already runs photutils. Revisit it for forced photometry.
- A custom scheduler or daemon for long runs: that would rebuild `/loop` and `/schedule`.

**Evidence.** MAST product sizes measured 2026-10-07 (catalog ~3 MB vs i2d ~1.8 GB; SOURCES.md "Data").

**Revisit if.** Cross-band colors from independently detected catalogs prove too noisy (then use a
forced-photometry HLSP catalog or photutils on i2d mosaics), or the sample grows beyond memory
(then use Parquet partitions or a database).
